# Assembly StopWatch

World's fastest stopwatch... maybe not ;D. It's a stopwatch written in assembly, using sys calls for the sleeping part and printing on screen

> Note: It isn't accurate since in each loop it also calls a `update_display`, which takes a lot of time, though for this fun activity i believe it's okay to ignore this now
